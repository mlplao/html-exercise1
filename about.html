 <p>About

Founded in 1993, Books n' Beans had its humble beginnings as a resale store for outdated college textbooks. As its cult status in the community grew, so did customer demand for a reliable source of caffeine. Thus, the current iteration of Books n' Beans was born.

We're open 7 days a week, offering impeccable coffee, fine pastries, and the most esoteric of publications.

Stop in for a hot beverageâ€”stick around for lost French translations of Howard Zinn!

Sincerely,

Your Friends at Books n' Beans
